2.Where to get source code
The source code is maintained in the Git repository
To download, follow the below command
git clone https://github.com/netradyne/vvdn-release-28.2.git

3.Where to get Toolchain
Toolchain is available in s3 server.
s3://netradyne-vvdn-sharing/ntdi_icdc_toolchain.tar.gz -Extract this in /opt folder.
Toolchain is also available in SVN.
https://192.168.100.150/viewvc/ntdi_icdc/toolchain/

4.Steps for Compilation
A. 	Base directory = /Linux_for_Tegra_28.2/
B. 	Get the tar file of Root-Filesystem from the following path
s3://netradyne-vvdn-sharing/ NTDI_Linux_Root-Filesystem_R28.2_v3.0.2.1_20190423_aarch64.tar.bz2
Extract the tar file in the Base directory
sudo tar â€“xvjf NTDI_Linux_Root-Filesystem_R28.2_v3.0.2.1_20190423_aarch64.tar.bz2
C.	Change to the Sources directory
Sources directory = /Linux_for_Tegra_28.2/sources
Run the below commands:
*make all
D.	Go to Base directory and run the below command:
sudo./apply_binaries.sh

5.Steps to flash image
Run the flash.sh script that is in the top-level directory of this release. The script must be supplied with the target board (jetson-tx1) for the root file system:

sudo ./flash.sh  

Where  depends on where the root file system is located.

sudo ./flash.sh jetson-tx1 mmcblk0p1


6.Files add in .gitignore
We are already clean the code before pushing in git.
So there is no file to add in the .gitignore.
